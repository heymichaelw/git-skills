    <h1>Michael Waites</h1>
    <p>I'm from a small town you've never heard of, so it's easier to say I'm from Columbia, SC!  Before I decided to come to The Iron Yard, I was a barista for six years.  I didn't want to pay an outrageous sum of money to be in school for four years, so coding seemed like a good opportunity to learn a marketable skill in a manageable time frame.</p>
